Problem 1 : Linear Regression using the UCI Wine Quality dataset

1.1 Implement linear regression and return the model parameters
1.2 Implement your regularized linear regression algorithm to prevent overfitting 
1.3 Tuning the regularization hyper-parameter using the validation set 
1.4 Report the mean square error of the model on the give n test set


Problem 2 : k Nearest Neighbors for Handwritten Digits Classification

2.1 Compute the distance between test data points in X and training data points in Xtrain
2.2 Implement kNN classifier. Output the predictions for the test set
2.3 Report the classification accuracy
    accuracy = # of correctly classified test examples / # of test examples
2.4 Tuning k : Find k among  1, 3, 5, 7, 9  that gives the best classification accuracy on the validation set

k, Accuracy

1, 0.943
3, 0.939
5, 0.941
7, 0.931
9, 0.929
test 0.932

Achieved an accuracy of 93.2% on the test set
